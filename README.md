Create Inverted Border Radius Cards using CSS :
  This project demonstrates how to create visually striking inverted border radius cards and add a rotating logo using CSS. 
  The first part of the project focuses on designing a card element where the corners are given a unique "inverted" border radius.
  Instead of the typical rounded corners, negative values are applied to the border-radius property, which creates an interesting geometric shape for the card.
  This gives the card a modern and edgy look. To further enhance the design, a logo is included within the card, and CSS animations are used to apply a rotating effect. 
  By leveraging @keyframes, the logo undergoes a smooth continuous rotation, giving it a dynamic, eye-catching appearance. 
  The transform property and the rotate() function control the angle of rotation, ensuring the logo spins gracefully.
  This project is an excellent example of how CSS can be used to create interactive, visually engaging elements with minimal code.
